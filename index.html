                    <p class="answer">Quality is extremely hard to define, and it is simply stated: "Fit for use or purpose." It is all about meeting the needs and expectations of customers with respect to functionality, design, reliability, durability, & price of the product.</p>

                    <p class="answer">Assurance is nothing but a positive declaration on a product or service, which gives confidence. It is certainty of a product or a service, which it will work well. It provides a guarantee that the product will work without any problems as per the expectations or requirements.</p>

                <h3 class="question-title" >Quality Assurance in Software Testing</h3>
                
                <p class="answer">Quality Assurance in Software Testing is defined as a procedure to ensure the quality of software products or services provided to the customers by an organization. Quality assurance focuses on improving the software development process and making it efficient and effective as per the quality standards defined for software products. Quality Assurance is popularly known as QA Testing.</p>

                <h3 class="question-title" >Difference between Quality Control and Quality Assurance?</h3>
                
                <p class="answer">Sometimes, QC is confused with the QA. Quality control is to examine the product or service and check for the result. Quality Assurance in Software Engineering is to examine the processes and make changes to the processes which led to the end-product.</p>

                <h3 class="question-title" >How Quality Assurance Works</h3>
                
                <p class="answer">Quality assurance methods focus on establishing good processes to produce products with the quality already built-in, rather than going through an unmonitored production process and trying to “inspect the quality” of a product that’s already been finished.
                   Concepts of quality control can be traced back to at least the Middle Ages and the rise of guilds. A craftsman could access a network of connections with other craftsmen and suppliers by joining a guild organization. He could then benefit from the reputation of the guild based on standards of quality in the products produced by its members.
                   The Industrial Revolution brought about more specialization in labor, as well as mechanization. Quality assurance evolved to address specialized tasks performed by workers. With the introduction of mass production, the need to monitor the quality of components being produced by large numbers of workers created a role for quality inspectors.</p>
